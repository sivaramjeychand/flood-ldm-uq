## Abstract
Flood prediction is critical for emergency planning and response to mitigate human and economic losses. Traditional physics-based hydrodynamic models generate high-resolution flood maps using numerical methods requiring fine-grid discretization; which are computationally intensive and impractical for real-time large-scale applications. While recent studies have applied convolutional neural networks for flood map super-resolution with good accuracy and speed, they suffer from limited generalizability to unseen areas. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages latent diffusion models to perform super-resolution on coarse-grid flood maps, with the objective of achieving the accuracy of fine-grid flood maps while significantly reducing inference time. Experimental results demonstrate that latent diffusion models substantially decrease the computational time required to produce high-fidelity flood maps without compromising on accuracy, enabling their use in real-time flood risk management. Moreover, diffusion models exhibit superior generalizability across different physical locations, with transfer learning further accelerating adaptation to new geographic regions. Our approach also incorporates physics-informed inputs, addressing the common limitation of black-box behavior in machine learning, thereby enhancing interpretability.

## Pretrained models
This section contains the latent diffusion model checkpoints. `_gen.pth` files contain the model parameters and are needed for inference, while `_opt.pth` files contain the saved optimizer and are needed for further transfer learning. The pretrained autoencoder checkpoint can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OurEy9H589z9jXHj-cXtZ1pfyUcCQlIJ?usp=sharing).

| Training Catchment | CG-FG MSE | SR-FG-MSE | % change | Download |
| :----------------: | :-------: | :-------: | :------: | :------: |
| Wollombi | 344.2 | 33.7 | -90.20 | [checkpoint](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lu39Zfs-wA01czTXvnoOOI5LSeClRZk2?usp=sharing) |
| Burnett | 5957.4 | 723.0 | -87.86 | [checkpoint](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mp4n1uPkRVhe27OpUUnkoE726Wx2agYL?usp=sharing) |
| Chowilla | 158.7 | 17.4 | -89.07 | [checkpoint](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1m5hnVxXkf6R8kkpJbeKljij_TqobRqSf?usp=sharing) |

After downloading the model checkpoints, edit the appropriate variables in the config file:
```json
"resume_state": "/path/to/pretrained/model",
"vae_state": "/path/to/pretrained/vae",
"vae_dem_state": "/path/to/pretrained/dem/vae"
```
Do not include the `_gen.pth`/`_opt.pth` in the path to the pretrained LDM, the parser will automatically detect both files as long as they are in the same directory.

## Requirements
Python 3.10.12+
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Config
Different configuration options for training and testing of models are specified in a json file and can be passed into the training/testing command via a command-line argument. The `config` directory contains config files for reference, including examples of a [standard diffusion model](config/wollombi-5-01norm.json) and a [latent diffusion model](config/wollombi-trnf.json). 

2 diffusion model architectures are available in this codebase, adapted from the [SR3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.07636) and [DDPM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11239) papers. The desired model architecture can be selected using the `which_model_G` variable in the config file. It is recommended to use the `sr3` architecture for standard diffusion models and the `ddpm` architecture for latent diffusion models.

## Dataset
Training and Test data for all catchments can be found [here](https://doi.org/10.25910/EZQ6-GG56).

### Catchment data structure
Catchment data should be stored in this folder structure:

```

## Training
Training is done with the following command:
```
python sr.py -p train -c config.json -output-dir path/to/output/dir
```
The model checkpoints will be stored in the output directory.

## Testing
Testing is done with the following command:
```
python sr.py -p test -c config.json -output-dir path/to/output/dir
```
The super-resolution model outputs will be saved in the output directory if the corresponding option is set in the config file.
